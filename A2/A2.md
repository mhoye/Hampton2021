## Phase Overview

During this phase, an initial prototype of the extension was built. This introduces the tool&#39;s icon in the top right corner of the FireFox browser that allows users to interact with timer sliders for **Focus Time (hrs)**, and **Work Interval (mins)**.

## High Level Design

_Focus_ is a productivity tool to allow users to achieve an organized workflow through a simple interface that is not invasive to their browsing activity. This entails a widget interface with sliders to select a work time and break time to enforce a pomodoro routine on the user. This timer would visibly count down without interfering with browser activity until the count is complete.

## Challenges/Technical Highlights

Building a web application and turning it into a mozilla add on - implementing our product under the constraints of a browser extension. Figuring out the flow under a singular webpage.

- Displaying the timer - possible through an icon that is changed dynamically
  - Due to the nature of browser extensions, the time status may have to be expressed through the extension&#39;s icon. This will mean we will need to figure out how to change the icon dynamically.
- The implementation of the timer is guided by reference to the _Mind the Time_ add on by Paul Morris and LeechBlock by James Anderson.

## Teamwork Reflection

Worked well:

- Picked concepts up relatively quickly for the first time making an extension and implementing code into the add on interface.
- Picking up JavaScript, HTML

Needs Improvement:

- Team meetings - not as often as we planned to
- communication

## Prospective Final Product

Our final product aims to have complete timer functionality in which the tool will effectively store user entered time values to conduct a pomodoro cycle with the given time values with status messages to alert the user about information regarding their session i.e end of session, break time.
